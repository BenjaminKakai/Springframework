# Springframework
To install the Spring Framework on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

Update the package list on your system by running the command sudo apt-get update.

Install the JDK (Java Development Kit) by running the command sudo apt-get install default-jdk.

Download the Spring Framework distribution archive file from the official website (https://spring.io/tools).

Extract the archive file to a directory of your choice. For example, you can extract it to the '/opt' directory by running the command tar xzf spring-framework-version.tar.gz -C /opt.

Set the environment variables by adding the following lines to your .bashrc file:
export SPRING_HOME=/opt/spring-framework-version
export PATH=$PATH:$SPRING_HOME/bin

Reload the .bashrc file by running the command source ~/.bashrc

Verify the installation by running the command spring --version

Finally, you can use the Spring Framework by creating a new project using the Spring Initializer (https://start.spring.io/) or import an existing project into an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
